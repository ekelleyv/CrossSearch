By Alex Johnson Reporter msnbc.com msnbc.com updated 11/5/2008 3:10:53 PM ET 2008-11-05T20:10:53 Share Print Font: + - Barack Obama, a 47-year-old first-term senator from Illinois, shattered more than 200 years of history Tuesday night by winning election as the first African-American president of the United States. A crowd of nearly a quarter-million jammed Grant Park and the surrounding area in Chicago, where Obama addressed the nation for the first time as its president-elect at midnight ET. Hundreds of thousands more ó Mayor Richard Daley said he would not be surprised if a million Chicagoans jammed the streets ó watched on a large television screen outside the park. ìIf there is anyone out there who doubts that America is a place where anything is possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer,î Obama declared.

McCain notes history in the making Obama congratulated his opponent, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, for his ìunimaginableî service to the United States, first as a prisoner of war for 5Ω years in North Vietnam and then for nearly three decades in Congress. McCain called Obama to offer his congratulations at 11 p.m. ET, Obamaís chief spokesman, Robert Gibbs, told NBC News. Obama thanked McCain for his ìclass and honorî during the campaign and said he was eager to sit down and talk about how the two of them could work together. Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices ìThe American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly,î McCain told supporters in Phoenix, saying that he ìrecognized the special significanceî Obamaís victory had for African-Americans. ìWe both recognize that though we have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nationís reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship, the memory of them still have the power to wound,î McCain said. ìLet there be no reason for any American to fail to cherish their citizenship in this, the greatest nation on Earth,î said McCain, who pledged his support and help for the new president. President Bush called to congratulate Obama and promise a smooth transition of power on Jan. 20, White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said. ìMr. President-elect, congratulations to you. What an awesome night for you, your family and your supporters,î said Bush, who invited Obama and his family to visit the White House as soon as it was convenient. The president also called McCain to say that he was proud of the senatorís efforts and that he was ìsorry it didnít work out.î ìYou didnít leave anything on the playing field,î Bush said. Broad, deep victory Campaigning as a technocratic agent of change and not a pathbreaking civil rights figure, Obama swept to victory over McCain, whose running mate, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, was seeking to become the nationís first female vice president. Obama beat McCain by 52 percent to 46 percent, and he could realistically claim a mandate with nearly two-thirds of the Electoral College. As of Wednesday afternoon, he had 349 electoral votes compared to 173 for McCain, with only North Carolina and Nebraskaís 2nd Congressional District left to declare. And Obama should have a strongly supportive Congress to work with. Not since 1993 has an incoming president had such strong majorities in both houses of Congress. Democrats will hold 258 of the 435 seats in the House and at least 54 of the 100 seats in the Senate , where t wo independents also caucus with the party. Four seats remained undecided, meaning the party mathematically could reach a procedurally important ìsupermajorityî of 60 or more votes in the Senate, but NBC News projected that it would not reach that threshold. Surveys of voters as they left polling places nationwide encapsulated the historic nature of the victory by Obama, the son of a Kenyan father and a white mother from Kansas. As expected, he won overwhelmingly among African-American voters, but he also won among women and Latino voters. And he won by more than 2-to-1 among voters of all races 30 years old and younger. Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices That dynamic was telling in Ohio and in Pennsylvania, where McCain poured in millions of dollars of scarce resources. Obama won both, along with Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and New York, all states with hefty electoral vote hauls, NBC News projected. McCain countered with Texas and numerous smaller states, primarily in the South and the Great Plains. In interviews with NBC News, aides to McCain said they were proud that they had put up a good fight in ìhistorically difficult times.î A senior adviser said McCain himself was ìfineî but that he felt ìhe let his staff and supporters down.î ëTransformation of Americaí In the end, Florida, the scene of electoral chaos in recent votes, had little impact. The state had been watched closely, but results there and in some other closely contested states were delayed until after Obama clinched his victory, as record numbers of voters flocked to polling stations, energized by an election in which they would select either the nationís first black president or its first female vice president. The percentage of Americans who voted was unmatched in at least a generation and perhaps since 1908, according to election experts. Secretaries of state estimated turnouts approaching 90 percent in Virginia and Colorado and 80 percent or more in big states like Ohio, California, Texas, Virginia, Missouri and Maryland. Voters were lured to the polls by the historic nature of an election that held the potential to yield an African-American president and reject the party of an unpopular president. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., a legend of the civil rights movement of the 1960s, said he was ìoverwhelmedî and had broken down in tears. ìI never imagined, I never even had any idea I would live to see an African-American president of the United States,î Lewis said in an interview on MSNBC. ìWe have witnessed tonight in America a revolution of values, a revolution of ideals,î Lewis said. ìThereís been a transformation of America, and it will have unbelievable influence on the world.î Ellora Lyons, 81, of Peoria, Ill., recalled boarding a train to Oklahoma with her two oldest boys in 1948. Her brother had been killed in an accident, and they were going to his funeral. ìThere was a sign on this train that said, 'n-----s to the back,íî she said. ìAnd we couldnít drink out of the same water fountain.î Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices ìI remember my mom and my dad talking about black folks being not able to vote,î Lyons said. ìI never thought that I would see a black man [in the White House], but I was hoping that one day that a black man would run for president.î All told, election experts said nearly 140 million Americans voted, many of them minority, immigrant and younger Americans who were casting their ballots for the first time. Maria Reyes, who immigrated from El Salvador and was sworn in as a citizen in August, was one of them. She cast her ballot with help from her daughter, Elvia. ìItís wonderful time for our country right now ó Obama!î Reyes said as she waved a small American flag. In the Little Saigon section of Los Angeles, Timothy Ngo, a Vietnamese immigrant, turned out to support McCain. ìI came here as a refugee, so Mr. McCain and I grew up and fought in the same war in Vietnam,î Ngo said. Obama, McCain cast their ballots Obama and his wife, Michelle, voted with their young daughters at their sides at Beulah Shoesmith Elementary School in Hyde Park, Ill. The family was ushered inside ahead of a line of their neighbors that wrapped around the block. Fellow voters watched in silence and snapped cell-phone pictures. They cheered when Obama held up his validation slip with a smile and said, ìI voted.î ìThe journey ends, but voting with my daughters, that was a big deal,î he told reporters later. Obamaís final days of campaigning were bittersweet: He was mourning the loss of his grandmother Madelyn Dunham, who helped raise him but died of cancer Sunday night and never got to see the results of the historic election. In Delaware, Obamaís running mate, Sen. Joe Biden, went to the polls with his elderly mother. Speaking to reporters on his plane, Biden said he had made a deal with his wife, Jill. ìIf you get the vice presidency and get elected, you can get a dog,î Biden said his wife told him. ìI know what kind I want, [but] I donít know what kind Iím going to get yet. Weíre not there yet. The dealís not closed yet.î McCain, meanwhile, cast his ballot early Tuesday at a church near his home in central Phoenix. A small crowd cheered ìGo, John, go!î and ìWe love you!î as he stepped out of a sport utility vehicle with his wife, Cindy. One person carried a sign that read, ìUse your brain, vote McCain!î Palin returned to where her political career began to cast her vote in the snow-dusted, two-story Wasilla City Hall where she once presided as a small-town mayor. Palin, accompanied by her husband, Todd, voted just after 7 a.m. Tuesday, pushing aside a red, white and blue curtain on a voting booth and handing her white paper ballot to a clerk. © 2011 msnbc.com Reprints Show more text Video: ëEnd of a long journeyí Open in new window Discuss: Discussion comments ì î Expand Collapse , Reply Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices Advertise | AdChoices View all comments Leave your comment You Most active discussions votes comments votes comments votes comments votes comments Show discussion Related: Decision '08 archive , Barack Obama, McCain Advertise | AdChoices More from Politics Clinton visits Tokyo in show of support for Japan Obama: Most people confident he was born in US Obama assesses GOP budget: 'Wrong for America' Obama on GOP: 'You want to repeal health care?

Electors gathering in state capitols across the country have pushed Obama above the 270 electoral votes needed to win, according to a tally by The Associated Press. Obama takes office Jan. 20, becoming the nation's first black president. Monday's voting was a largely ceremonial procedure, but one mandated by the Constitution. Obama defeated Republican Sen. John McCain in the Nov. 4 election. More than 131 million voters cast ballots ó the most ever in a presidential election. But Obama's election will not be complete until Congress tallies the outcome of Monday's Electoral College vote at a joint session scheduled for Jan. 6. Copyright 2008 The Associated Press.

Democrat Barack Obama was elected to a four-year term as the next president of the United States Tuesday night, easily defeating his rival, Arizona Republican John McCain. According to CNN, Obama, an Illinois senator, has thus far won 338 electoral votes, while McCain has 163. Obama needed a minimum of 270 electoral votes to claim victory. Three states, Indiana, Missouri and North Carolina, haven't yet been called. In the Senate, CNN projects the Democrats won 17 seats in the election for a total of 56 seats, while the Republicans won 14 seats for a total of 40. Four contests remain to be decided. After his win, Obama told supporters that "change has come to America," as he addressed the country for the first time as the president-elect. "If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer," Obama said in his victory speech in Chicago. Photo Gallery: Race for the White House Police estimated more than 200,000 people gathered in Grant Park to hear Obama claim victory, CNN reports. "The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even one term, but America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there. I promise you, we as a people will get there," Obama said.

Walsh Posted: November 4, 2008 Print More News Two Udall Cousins Win Senate Seats Schlesinger: You'll Recall Where You Were When, and Smile Farrell: Correcting Our Greatest Sin Erbe: The Southern Strategy Falls Barack Obama has been elected the 44th president of the United Statesóthe first time an African-American has won the nation's highest office and the rare occasion where a newcomer to national politics has captured the White House on his first try. Obama easily won the 270 electoral votes needed for victory. He held all the states won by Democrat John Kerry in 2004, including the megastates of New York and California, but also carried several swing states that went Republican four years ago, including Ohio, Florida, Virginia, and New Mexico. His opponent, Republican Senator John McCain conceded defeat in a speech to supporters in Arizona. Obama, a freshman senator from Illinois, will become the fifth youngest president ever, at 47. He was propelled by a huge public desire for change and deep anxiety about the ongoing economic crisis. Obama also capitalized on the intense unpopularity of President Bush by tying GOP nominee John McCain to Bush's Republican policies, especially on the economy. In early September, the race seemed very close as many voters expressed concern about Obama's inexperience, especially on national-security issues, and his liberal views. But the meltdown on Wall Street and in the financial markets changed the dynamic. Voters decided that McCain's conservative approach had been tried and it failed. And they opted for the newcomer who advocated more activist government and has pledged a relentless commitment to improving the life of the middle class. The campaign was historic in several ways. Not only did it result in the election of a black president in a country that has a history of slavery and segregation; it also resulted in the election of the second Catholic on a major-party ticket in Vice President-elect Joe Biden of Delaware. (The first Catholic was President John F. Kennedy, elected in 1960.) Further, the campaign featured the first woman vice presidential candidate for the GOP in Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And the initial analysis of exit polls indicated that young people, African-Americans, and new voters turned out in huge numbers. Click here for the latest election results.

They won't focus on William Ayers or Joe the Plumber or socialism or racism. They won't debate whether John McCain blew it by targeting Pennsylvania or by avoiding the press or by ignoring the Rev. Jeremiah Wright or by picking Sarah Palin as a running mate. They won't remember the robo-calls or "cling" or the Paris Hilton ad or the crazy chick who carved the B into her face. The pundits filling airtime on their 24-hour news channels might have cared, but posterity won't. No, when historians analyze the 2008 campaign, they're going to remember that the two-term Republican President had 20% approval ratings, that the economy was in meltdown, and that Americans didn't want another Republican President. They'll also remember that Obama was a change candidate in a change election. And of course they'll remember that America elected a biracial leader less than a half-century after Jim Crow. But that's just about all they'll remember. Politics is a lot simpler than the pundits pretend. The Republican recriminations will be ugly, but McCain was probably the most electable candidate the party had: a genuine war hero with an impressive record of public service that didn't always include marching in lockstep with George W. Bush. He threw some Hail Mary passes ? Palin; the "suspension" of his campaign ? but he didn't have much of a choice against a Democratic tide. He was the right guy in the wrong year. If Washington Republicans decide that he lost because he was too squishy on immigration or too pro-regulation in his response to the economic crisis or too mavericky, they could find themselves cocooning in the wilderness for a long time. (See pictures of John McCain's final push on the campaign trail.) Remember what eight years of Republican rule has wrought: missing weapons of mass destruction, the promises we'd be greeted as liberators, Jessica Lynch, torture, the disintegration of Afghanistan. Also: Enron, WorldCom, Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie and Freddie, GM, Chrysler, Social Security privatization, the $700 billion bailout. Also: Brownie, John Ashcroft covering up that bare-breasted statue at the Justice Department, Alberto Gonzales politicizing the Justice Department, Harriet Miers, the oil lobbyist who edited those global warming reports. Also: Jack Abramoff, Duke Cunningham, Bob Ney, Tom DeLay, Ted Stevens. Also: the Vice President shot a guy, and the President almost choked to death on a pretzel. (See the screwups of Campaign '08.) And McCain still almost won Virginia! It's going down to the wire in Florida! All things considered, that's a pretty impressive showing. The pundits are already warning that Obama could overreach, that Democratic congressional leaders are still unpopular, that this is still a center-right country. But it wasn't tonight. Obama will have the luxury of taking office at a time when the GOP is the AIG of electoral politics, when his predecessor has set the lowest bar since James Buchanan, when a supposedly conservative Administration just started nationalizing the banking system, when the public is desperate for change. What is it about tonight's results that suggests Obama should be afraid of progressive action on the cusp of a depression? (See pictures of the campaign from Barack Obama's point of view.) But those are questions for another day. The big news tonight is that whether or not there's a Bradley effect, it's nowhere near as big as the Bush effect. And now a guy who would have had to ride the back of the bus in some of this country when he was a kid has grown up to run this country. Historians will remember that.
